# Monorail V2

This board adapts the original **Monorail VÂ²** however some fundamental changes were made to fit into a different case by **M4NU**.

**DISCLAIMER**: This board is currently in development and no working pcb nor a prototype were made yet


Version 2 is based on the RP2040 and has encoder positions on ESC, 1, and 6.

Plate files made up of the same outlines as are found in the Trashman Wiki, and enough permutations have been tested to be confident in their functionality.

More plate files can be found at https://www.minivanplate.xyz/

The "Combined" plates have support for all of the layouts from all three PCBs.

Vial firmware was built on this commit of the NCKiser fork of Vial, based on QMK v0.18 : https://github.com/NCKiser/vial-nckiser/commit/2a0371c2ef1b1343f7dda704ad11ff06da6e896c
